# Overview

I've created a blackjack game. 
There are no requirements for the game to work

## Installation

There are no requirements.txt, since there is no imports. 

## Usage

You start with a set amount of money to play for, in this case a 100.

After you start the game you will be asked to place a bet. It is important that you type in an 'int' and not a 'String. 
This will couse the game to crash. When promptet an input, you have to type the words / letters, exactly like the game asks you. 

An examble of input: "do you want to hit or stay? (type hit/stay)", you then either type "hit" or "stay". NOT "HIT" or "Hit". 

Another examble is: "do you want to split? (Y/N)", you then have to type "Y" (for yes) or "N" (for no).
