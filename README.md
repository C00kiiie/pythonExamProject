# Overview

I've created a blackjack game. 
There are no requirements for the game to work

## Installation

There are no requirements.txt, since there are no imports. 
The only thing that need to be run is, Blackjack.py

## Usage

You start with a set amount of money to play for, in this case a 100$.

After you start the game you will be asked to place a bet. When promptet an input, you have to type the words / letters, exactly like the game asks you. An examble of input: 
"do you want to hit or stay? (type hit/stay)", you then either type "hit" or "stay". NOT "HIT" or "Hit". Another examble is: "do you want to split? (Y/N)", you then have to type "Y" (for yes) or "N" (for no).

When you played a game, there will be a score of how many games you / lost, and a quetion about replaying.
should you choose to not replay, the game will end. If you should choose to play the game again, you will be asked to place a bet, and the game will continue as before.
